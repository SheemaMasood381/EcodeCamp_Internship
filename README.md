## ðŸš€ Project 1: Customer Churn Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a customer churn dataset. The primary objective was to identify patterns and trends that could help businesses understand the factors leading to customer churn and improve their retention strategies.

### Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Extracted meaningful insights regarding customer behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Created comprehensive visualizations like histograms and scatter plots to effectively communicate findings.
- **Business Insights**: Provided actionable insights that can influence customer retention strategies.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

### Project Files
You can find the project files in the [Customer Churn Analysis](./Customer-Churn-Analysis) directory.

## ðŸš€ Project 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
This project involved developing a **Titanic Survival Prediction Web Application** that predicts the likelihood of a passengerâ€™s survival on the Titanic based on various input features.

### Key Features
- **Interactive User Interface**: Users can interact with the app via an age slider, passenger class selection, gender dropdown, and port of embarkation dropdown.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented a `RandomForestClassifier` that achieved 85% accuracy and an 89% F1 score.
- **Web Deployment**: Deployed using Flask, offering real-time predictions and smooth user interactions.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Flask**
- **HTML/CSS**

### Project Files
You can find the project files in the [Titanic Survival Prediction](./Titanic-Survival-Prediction) directory.

## ðŸš€ Project 3: Image Classification with CNNs

### Overview
In my final internship project, I developed an **interactive Image Classification System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is capable of classifying images with high accuracy and is accessible through a user-friendly web interface.

### Key Features
- **Advanced CNN Architecture**: Designed a robust CNN model with multiple layers, batch normalization, dropout, and advanced regularization techniques.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 92% accuracy on test images and 87% on unseen images.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Users can upload images and receive instant classification results through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Flask**
- **HTML/CSS**

### Project Files
You can find the project files in the [Image Classification with CNNs](./Image-Classification-CNN) directory.
