# Project Overview
This repository showcases my work during the internship at Ecodecamp. The tasks involve various aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and deployment. The goal is to develop and deploy machine learning models that provide valuable insights and predictions based on the given datasets.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
### Overview
In this task, I built a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. The project involved data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using different machine learning algorithms.

### Key Features
    1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of survival distributions based on different features like gender, class, and age.
    2. Model Building: Implementation of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN.
    3. Model Evaluation: Confusion matrices and accuracy scores were used to evaluate model performance.
    4. Deployment: The final model was deployed using Flask, allowing predictions based on user input.
    
### Files
Task 3/: Contains all relevant files, including Jupyter notebooks, model files, and Flask app files.

## Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction (Telco Data)
### Overview
The second task will involve building a predictive model for customer churn using Telco customer data. This project will focus on identifying factors that influence customer churn and developing a model to predict churn.

### Key Features (Planned)
    1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key factors contributing to customer churn.
    3. Model Building: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict customer churn.
    4. Model Evaluation: Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Files
Coming soon.

## Task 3: To Be Decided
### Overview
The third task is yet to be decided. It will likely involve another challenging dataset where advanced machine learning techniques can be applied.
