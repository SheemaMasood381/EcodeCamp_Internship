## Project Overview

This repository showcases my work during the internship at Ecodecamp. The tasks involve various aspects of data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and deployment. The goal is to develop and deploy machine learning models that provide valuable insights and predictions based on the given datasets.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview

In this task, I built a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. The project involved data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using different machine learning algorithms.

### Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of survival distributions based on different features like gender, class, and age.
- **Model Building:** Implementation of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN.
- **Model Evaluation:** Confusion matrices and accuracy scores were used to evaluate model performance.
- **Deployment:** The final model was deployed using Flask, allowing predictions based on user input.

### Files

- **[Task 1/](Task%201/):** Contains all relevant files, including Jupyter notebooks, model files, and Flask app files.

## Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction (Telco Data)

### Overview

For this task, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset to identify patterns and insights. The focus was on understanding factors contributing to customer churn and generating a comprehensive report of findings.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identification of key factors contributing to customer churn through visualizations and statistical analyses.
- **Report:** Creation of a comprehensive report detailing findings and insights from the analysis.

### Files

- **[Task 2/](Task%202/):** Contains all relevant files, including Jupyter notebooks and the comprehensive report of findings and insights. The report can be found [here](Task%202/Churn_Analysis_Report.pdf) (replace with actual file name and path).

## Task 3: To Be Decided

### Overview

The third task is yet to be decided. It will likely involve another challenging dataset where advanced machine learning techniques can be applied.

### Files

- **[Task 3/](Task%203/):** Contains all relevant files, including Jupyter notebooks and any other resources related to the task.
